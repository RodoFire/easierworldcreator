## Info
### Wiki
I highly recommend you go to check the wiki to understand everything that is possible : [Mod-Wiki](https://github.com/RodoFire/easierworldcreator/wiki)
### Performance
this mod use is own maths that you can use For example calculating 1 000 000 cosinus :
gives an avarage calculating time of 476 ms when using `Math.cos()`, using the custom maths, you get an average time of 7ms when using `FatsMaths.getFastCos()` and an average of 14ms when using `FastMaths.getPreciseCos()`

### Using the library
the methods comes with common parameter : 

`StructureWorldAccess world` that is used to put the structure in the world. `StructureWorldAccess` allow you to use the feature either during world gen or not

`BlockPos pos` the position of the center of the structure

`List<BlockLayer> layers` a list of BlockLayer, see the wiki for more info : [Mod-Wiki](https://github.com/RodoFire/easierworldcreator/wiki)

The different size required for the shape to place


## Future?
I continue to develop actively this mod to support more and more possible things. You have any idea, suggestion on how to improve the mod? Let me know on the [github](https://github.com/RodoFire/easierworldcreator).
